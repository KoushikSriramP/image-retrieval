# This is my  Image Retreival academic project 

- This project is a re-implementation of the Query Based Image Retreival project
- This is implemented in python
- TensorFlow and Keras libraries are used for the feature extraction and Machine learning models 
- Flask lib is used to host the model in a webpage

## Steps to be done before running the pthton file
- These empty Directories and sub-directories are to be created as follows:
- static
 - feature
 - img
 - uploaded
- templates
- After these steps Place the images that you want to extract features and output your final query in the /img folder

## Instruction to run the files
- 1. Open the offline.py file and run it first
- 2. open the server.py to initialize webpage 
- 3. Open the feature_extractor.py to extract and store all the feature vectors of the images
